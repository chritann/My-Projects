# My-Projects
This is a collection of some of the many projects I've worked on. Most of these are drivers written for an AVR microcontroller for driving peripherals such as wireless transceivers, bluetooth modules, accelorometers, battery management ICs, etc. as well as designs for schematics and PCB layouts.
